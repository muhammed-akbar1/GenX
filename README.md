# [Brew Buddy] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [GenX]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Muhammed Akbar] - [College of Engineering Trivandrum]
- Member 2: [Anu An Mariya] - [College of Engineering Trivandru]

### Project Description
[An AI-powered app that helps you find the fastest and most satisfying tea shop option near you based on travel times, queue lengths, and tea preferences ‚Äî plus it recommends a coffee based on your detected mood using your webcam!]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Everyone wastes time deciding where to get tea and guessing what coffee suits their mood. Why should choosing a drink be so complicated and slow?]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We made a smart, fun app that optimizes your tea time by balancing travel and preparation time with taste satisfaction ‚Äî and adds a mood-based coffee recommendation by detecting your facial expression live!]
